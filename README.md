## Introduction
House pricing prediction is essential for real estate and finance sectors. This project uses machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features.

## Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:
- Location coordinates (`long`, `lat`)
- Size metrics (`sqft_living`, `sqft_lot`)
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Number of floors, waterfront status, view quality, condition, grade
- Square footage above and below ground (`sqft_above`, `sqft_basement`)
- Year built and year renovated
- ZIP code
- House price (target variable)

## Installation
To run this project, install the required libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
